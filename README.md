# Hello World Script for Bash

Step 1
Open your text editor and create a new plain text named HelloWorld.sh.

Step 2
All scripts must begin with the shebang(#!) and since we are using bash, line 1 will look like this.

``#!/bin/bash``

Make sure to include ``echo Hello World`` under the shebang line and then save your script.

Save your HelloWorld.sh file.

Step 3

In order to run your script you will need to compile it first. Open your terminal and point the terminal to the folder that is holding the HelloWorld.sh file. 

If you saved HelloWorld.sh to your documents folder you would type:

``cd ~/documents``


In order to compile your script, we type ``chmod +x ./hello.sh`` once your inside the folder holding the HelloWord.sh file.

Step 4

After everything is done you can type ./HelloWorld.sh and you should get a response of "Hello World"
