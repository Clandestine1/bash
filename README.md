# Hello World Script for Bash

## Step 1:

- Open your text editor and create a new plain text named `HelloWorld.sh`.

- In order to save as plain text using textEdit, go to format and change to: make plain text.

## Step 2:

- All scripts must begin with the sheabang(#!) and since we are using bash, line 1 will look like this.

- `#!/bin/bash`

- Add the following code under the shebang line

- `greeting=Hello\ World

   function greet {
    echo $greeting
   }

   greet`

- Save your `HelloWorld.sh` file.

## Step 3:

- In order to run your script you will need to compile it first.

- Open your terminal and point the terminal to the folder that is holding the `HelloWorld.sh` file. 

- If you saved `HelloWorld.sh` to your documents folder you would type:

- `cd ~/documents`

## Step 4:

- In order to compile your script, inside the folder holding the `HelloWord.sh` file type:

- `chmod +x ./HelloWorld.sh`

## Step 5:

- After everything is done you can type:

- `./HelloWorld.sh`

- and you get a response of "Hello World"!
